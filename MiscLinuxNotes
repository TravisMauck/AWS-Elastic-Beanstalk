# I'm new to Linux so the following are notes for how to get the script onto the EC2 instance
# The script will copy the deployment file from the EC2 instance to the Elastic BeanStalk implementation

# For use with tutorial
# Deploying a High-Availability WordPress Website with an External Amazon RDS Database to Elastic Beanstalk
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/php-hawordpress-tutorial.html?refid=gs_card

# Use the following to install Git on the EC2 instance

$ sudo su
$ yum install git-core

# Use this to copy the script from the Github repository 
# I found wget was already installed on the EC2 instance

wget   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMauck/AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk/master/CopyToEbS3 CopyToEbS3.sh

# This makes it executable

$ chmod +x CopyToEbS3.sh

# To modify the script if needed

$ nano CopyToEbS3.sh

# To execute the script

$ ./CopyToEbS3.sh
