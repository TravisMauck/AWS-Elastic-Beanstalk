# I'm new to Linux so the following are notes for how to get the script onto the EC2 instance
# The script will copy the deployment file from the EC2 instance to the Elastic BeanStalk implementation

# For use with tutorial
# Deploying a High-Availability WordPress Website with an External Amazon RDS Database to Elastic Beanstalk
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/php-hawordpress-tutorial.html?refid=gs_card

# The CURL, WGET... command for loading WordPress work as is in the EC2 instance.
# the following are take staight from the turtorial

$ curl https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.9.5.tar.gz -o wordpress.tar.gz
$ wget https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-php-wordpress/releases/download/v1.1/eb-php-wordpress-v1.zip
$ tar -xvf wordpress.tar.gz
$ mv wordpress wordpress-beanstalk
$ cd wordpress-beanstalk
$ unzip ../eb-php-wordpress-v1.zip


# to update the IP address with your external IP address
$ cd .ebextensions
$ nano dev.config
# to update the VCP and subnets the default VPC id and subnet ids
$ nano efs-create.config
$ cd ..

$ zip ../wordpress-beanstalk.zip -r * .[^.]*

# Use the following to install Git on the EC2 instance

$ sudo su
$ yum install git-core

# Use this to copy the script from the Github repository 
# I found wget was already installed on the EC2 instance

# be sure to be in the root directory for this

wget   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMauck/AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk/master/CopyToEbS3 CopyToEbS3

# This makes it executable

$ chmod +x CopyToEbS3

# To modify the script to contain the appropriate S3 bucket, applications name and environment name

$ nano CopyToEbS3

# To execute the script
# The EC2 instance needs to have sufficient authority
# I assigned a role with full admin and it worked

# This time I had to assign a region even though last time I did not need to
$ aws configure set region us-west-2 

$ ./CopyToEbS3
